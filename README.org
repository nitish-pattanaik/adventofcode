* Introduction
- I'm completely a beginner in programming world.
- I'm still learning all of these.
- I'm here to practice my C programming. Hence I'll post all the solutions in C. (Or May be in C++, because they are related).
- I'll document all the learnings in my website.
- I'll post one blog for each day in ADVENT OF CODE.(Remember this is my first AOC challenge in 2023).
- Just remember I'm a COMPLETE BEGINNER.


* GOALS
- Solve one puzzle a day.
- Try to solve it and learn out of the process. Break down the problem in to small pieces and solve them one by one.
- Try to document your learning process by writing a blog every day.
- Take it as a challenge as well as a way to learn C programming.
- Update your code in the GitHub repository.
